I like the paring recommendations, and seeing on a scan how \"this wine\" compares to the others on the same shelf when I'm shopping (at least a consensus opinion). HOWEVER. Not being able to put them in my \"cellar\" without paying MONTHLY is a little aggressive. I get it, you want to make money. (As if by making a FREE app and making your money by selling wine through it isn't enough monthly already!) I'd rather pay a one-time of even $20 to unlock cellar and get all future updates for free than to shell out the $5/mo you are asking now. And let's consider the economics of my proposal. I'm not paying the monthly, nor will I, because I'm tracking my \"cellar\" through \"Cellar Tracker\" FOR FREE. So saving $60 a year is worth tracking them there and relegating your app for wine advice. $20 one-time v.s $0 all the time. The question you have to ask yourself is if you like being in second place with a smaller audience, or if you'd like to dominate first place by unlocking it for free and making your money through wine/related sales.
